I am currently making [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) & [Dendron](https://dendron.so). [Sharing things](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing), writing a [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) and [blog](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev) and building [ideas](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/ideas).

My present and past projects include:

## Learn Anything

[Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) is an [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) website to learn any topic as fast as possible.

The [end goal](https://docs.learn-anything.xyz/roadmap) is to create a machine learning system that can craft personalized study plans for learning any topic and an open knowledge graph anyone can explore and extend.

## Dendron

[Dendron](https://dendron.so/) is an hierarchical note taking tool that grows as you do. It's built on top of VSCode as an extension and creates published web pages for all the markdown files.

## Alfred Workflows

I love programming in Go and making [Alfred workflows](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows).

Here are some workflows I made that I use myself daily:

- [Web Searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches) - Search through any website (easily extendable list).
- [Ask Create Share](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-ask-create-share) - Create web submissions (Stack exchange, Reddit and more).
- [Learn Anything](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything) - Search through all topics in [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz).
- [My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) - Search through my bookmarks and notes.
- [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-awesome-lists) - Browse all [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) in seconds.
- [Small workflows](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows) - Small Alfred workflows I use.

## CLI tools

- [License Up](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/license-up) - Create a license quickly for a given name.

## Go libraries

- [Markdown parser](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/markdown-parser) - Parse markdown to grab various things.

## My macOS and iOS workflow

I share fully my [macOS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) and [iOS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios) personal setups. Where I share which applications and tools I use and love. I also share my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles). I [describe my workflow more extensively](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-workflow) in my wiki.

And I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw) to discuss all things automation on macOS/iOS.

## Curated lists

I mostly focus on curating and maintaining the various [curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists) which include things like [books](https://github.com/learn-anything/books), [courses](https://github.com/learn-anything/courses), [blogs](https://github.com/learn-anything/blogs) and more.

And I made a curated list of [privacy respecting tools and services](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting) and a list of ways to prepare and places to look to [find work programming](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/find-work).

## Other things

I am continuously [learning](https://www.notion.so/Learn-05c0eac7be904e0da89cd8a3bf7ab509), [writing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-articles), reading [books](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/books) and [research papers](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/research-papers), [making videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw/videos) and [writing code](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github).

I curate a GitHub list of all the interesting quotes I like [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/quotes).

Below are some of my favourite quotes from it that I really love.

Starting with my favourite quote of all by Alan Watts.

- We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.

If you don't know Alan Watts, I really do reccomend you [check who he is](http://www.alanwatts.com/). He wrote [a few books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1501668.Alan_W_Watts?from_search=true) and did [many talks](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alan+watts).

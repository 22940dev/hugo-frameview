👋 I love [making](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/sharing.html) things I have built with the world.

🔭 Currently building [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz), an [Open Source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) website for [learning any topic as fast as possible](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/White-Paper).

🎥 I also make [educational YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw) and share [music playlists](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/music/music-playlists.html).

💻 I am passionate about [macOS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os#readme) and automation so I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/macOSautomation) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.

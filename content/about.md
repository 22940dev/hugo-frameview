👋 I love [making](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/sharing.html) things I have built with the world.

📚 Currently making [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz), an [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything#readme) website for [learning any topic as fast as possible](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/White-Paper).

🌎 I am also helping build [Deedmob](https://www.deedmob.com), an online volunteering platform empowering everyone to do more good.

🖋 I love writing. You can read [all the articles](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-articles.html) I wrote on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev) or take a look through [my personal wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) where I share [everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/everything-I-know.html).

🌐 I share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev). I share my [code](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github.html) on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev) and you can see photos I took on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev).

🎥 I also make educational [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw) and share [music playlists](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/music/music-playlists.html).

💻 I am passionate about [macOS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os#readme) so I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/macOSautomation) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.

🍀 If you want to know even more about me, you can see [what I like](../likes) and [explore my wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) or even [search through it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind), if you like.

💛 You can support what I do on [Patreon](http://patreon.com/nikitavoloboev). Thank you.

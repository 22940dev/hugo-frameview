📒 I am an undergraduate student at Technical University of Eindhoven, majoring in Computer Science looking for an internship

🚙 Born in Moscow; currently based in Eindhoven, Netherlands

[📚 I am creating a Search Engine for learning any topic on Earth with mind maps](https://learn-anything.xyz/)

🚀 With it, I want to [accelerate the way in which people learn](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/the-invisible-mountains-bd50a31bc64e) by providing the most efficient paths to learn any topic on Earth

The [search engine](https://learn-anything.xyz/) searches through an [open database of community curated mind maps](https://github.com/learn-anything/maps)

🖋 I also love writing. You can read all that I have said on [Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) or [search for the article you want](https://my.mindnode.com/2YJ1yeqHkxaBMHKDPC1k2Ripxpx9Ne7ULk4rfh3H#211.9,-478.2,-1), perhaps I have written about it

💡 Aside from this, I am creating a [social platform](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas) to help nurture and grow ideas with the help of community

🎆 I am looking for internship and work opportunites in web or mobile development. My CV can be found [online](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/nikitavoloboev)

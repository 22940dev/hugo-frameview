👋 I love [making](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) and [sharing](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/sharing/sharing.html) things I have built with the world.

🚙 Born in Moscow; currently based in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

🔭 I am creating an [Open Source Website](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) for [learning any topic on Earth with Interactive Maps](https://learn-anything.xyz/).

🚀 With it, I want to [accelerate the way in which people learn](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/White-Paper) by providing the most efficient paths for learning anything.

🖋 I love writing. You can read all that I have said on [Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) or take a look at my [constantly expanding personal wiki](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/) where I share everything I know.

🌐 I share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev). I share my [code](https://my.mindnode.com/ZKGETDkUaQUsL3q8q9z788CxG84oEHgDiT79GuzX#-143.5,-902.6,0) on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev) and you can see the infrequent photos I take on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/).

🎥 I also make [educational YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw), share my [music playlists](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/music/music-plays.html) and occasionally [stream myself coding](https://www.twitch.tv/nikiivi).

💡 Aside from this, I am creating a [social platform](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas) to help nurture and grow ideas with the help of community.

🎆 I am looking for internship and work opportunites in web or mobile development. My CV can be found [online](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/nikitavoloboev).

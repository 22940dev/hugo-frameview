## Animals

I have been [vegeterian](https://learn-anything.xyz/philosophy/ethics/veganism) for over 4 years now and it has been one of the best decisions I have made thus far in my life

I think everyone has a choice nowadays of what they can eat and animal suffering can be avoided

## Great Software

Most notably

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
- [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
- [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/)
- [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
- [Safari](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Safari_(web_browser))

But there is [many more](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os)

I hope to build my own app or tool that will join this list soon too.

## Writing

I try to share my knowledge and experiences by writing about it in my [blog](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev).

## Photos

I really like collecting beautiful photographs and images but also making and creating photographs of my own.

Although I haven't had the chance to travel much yet.

## Music

I really love listening to new and interesting music and I curate some playlists of music I like on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0nGxteCFLXYA1fsLmlWzY0Tyoo3c7tF-) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev).
## Privacy

I have switched from using Google to instead using [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) and [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com) for all the searches I make.

Nor do I use Facebook, WhatsApp as I don't agree with its stance on collecting as much of one's personal data as possible.

I think it is important to be aware of ways in which companies can collect data about you and ways in which it can be manipulated and used against you.

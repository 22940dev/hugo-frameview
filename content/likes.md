## Animals

I have been [vegeterian](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/what-it-means-to-live-a-conscious-life-c96f6517077#.x3mzy1kcl) for over 4 years now and it has been one of the best decisions I have made thus far in my life

I think everyone has a choice nowadays of what they can eat and animal suffering can be avoided

## Writing

I try to share my knowledge and experiences by writing about it in my [blog](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) and I maintain my own [written knowledge wiki](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/) in the spirit of continuous learning

## Music

I really love listening to new and interesting music and I curate some playlists of music I like on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0nGxteCFLXYA1fsLmlWzY0Tyoo3c7tF-) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev).

## Photos

I really like [collecting beautiful photographs and images](https://nikivii.imgur.com) but also [making and creating photographs](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/) of my own.

Although I haven't had the chance to travel much yet.

## Great Software

Most notably

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
- [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
- [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/)
- [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
- [Safari](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Safari_(web_browser))

But there is [many more](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os)

I hope to build my own app or tool that will join this list soon too.

## Automation

I am a bit obsessed with automation and productivity. And I like to share all the interesting things I learn on this journey to a **perfect** setup.

Of course automation is not all and everything that I do but it greatly increases my satisfaction and happiness as I love focusing on solving problems and making new and interesting things rather than repeating myself over and over again.

## Privacy

I limit my use Facebook, WhatsApp as I don't agree with their stance on collecting as much of one's personal data as possible.

I think it is important to be aware of ways in which companies can collect data about you and ways in which it can be manipulated and used against you.

## Sharing

Although I do like my privacy, I also like sharing things and I am really open about most things I do and like as can be seen in this page already.

I share all my knowledge in a constantly updated wiki [here](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/) as well as me sharing my personal mind maps with links and notes [here](https://my.mindnode.com/myLVaRLKytoTYBLshxGzzb75MN9cyGHbQBgaVVPp#666.6,-32.8,-3).

I share most of the code I write and release it as Open Source for all other people to use and reuse it as they like.

And I also love tracking things for myself, like :

- [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15768482-nikita-voloboev)
- [movies](https://letterboxd.com/NikitaVoloboev/)
- [TV series and episodes](https://trakt.tv/users/nikivi)
- [music I listen to](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist)
- [games I liked](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi/)


## Quotes

I curate a GitHub list of all the interesting quotes I like [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/quotes).

Below are some of my favourite quotes from it that I really love.

Starting with my favourite quote of all by Alan Watts.

- We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.

If you don't know Alan Watts, I really do reccomend you [check who he is](http://www.alanwatts.com/). He wrote [a few books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1501668.Alan_W_Watts?from_search=true) and did [many talks](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alan+watts).

And here are some more quotes I really love.

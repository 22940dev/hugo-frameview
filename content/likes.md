## Animals
 - I have been [vegeterian](https://learn-anything.xyz/philosophy/ethics/veganism) for over 4 years now and it has been one of the best decisions I have made thus far in my life
 - I think everyone has a choice nowadays of what they can eat and animal suffering can be avoided

## Great Software

Most notably

- [Alfred](https://learn-anything.xyz/software/tooling/productivity/alfred)
- [Karabiner](https://learn-anything.xyz/software/tooling/productivity/karabiner)
- [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/)
- [VS Code](https://learn-anything.xyz/software/tooling/text-editors/vs-code)
- [Safari](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Safari_(web_browser))

But there is [many more](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os)

I hope to build my own app or tool that will join this list soon too.

## Writing

I try to share my knowledge and experiences by writing about it in my [blog](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev).

## Photos

I really like collecting beautiful photographs and images but also making and creating photographs of my own. Although I haven't had the chance to travel much yet.

## Animals
I have been [vegeterian](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/what-it-means-to-live-a-conscious-life-c96f6517077#.x3mzy1kcl) for over 4 years now and it has been one of the best decisions I have made thus far in my life.

I think everyone has a choice nowadays of what they can eat and animal suffering can be avoided.

## Sharing
I really [love sharing things](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/sharing.html) I make and I am really open about most things I do and like as can be seen in this page already.

I share most of the code I write and [release it as Open Source](https://my.mindnode.com/ZKGETDkUaQUsL3q8q9z788CxG84oEHgDiT79GuzX#-143.5,-902.6,0) for all other people to use and reuse as they like.

And I love [tracking all the various things](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/Tracking.html) about myself.

## Writing
I share my knowledge and experiences by writing about it in my [blog](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) and I maintain my own [personal wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) in the spirit of continuous learning.

## Music
I really love listening to new and interesting music and I curate [many playlists of music I like](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/music/music-plays.html).

## Photographs
I really like [collecting beautiful photographs and images](https://www.instagram.com/niikivi/) but also [creating photographs](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/) of my own.

## Great Software
Most notably

But there is [many more](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os).

I hope to build my own app or tool that will join this list soon too.

## Automation
I am a bit obsessed with automation and productivity. And I like to share all the interesting things I learn on this journey to a **perfect** setup.

Of course automation is not all and everything that I do but it greatly increases my satisfaction and happiness as I love focusing on solving problems and making new and interesting things rather than repeating myself over and over again.

## Quotes
I curate a GitHub list of all the interesting quotes I like [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/quotes).

Below are some of my favourite quotes that I really love.

Starting with my favourite quote of all by Alan Watts.

> We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.

If you don't know Alan Watts, I really do reccomend you [check who he is](http://www.alanwatts.com/). He wrote [a few books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1501668.Alan_W_Watts?from_search=true) and did [many talks](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alan+watts).

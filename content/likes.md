## Animals
I have been [vegeterian](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/what-it-means-to-live-a-conscious-life-c96f6517077#.x3mzy1kcl) for over 5 years now and it has been one of the best decisions I have made thus far in my life.

I think everyone has a choice nowadays of what they can eat and animal suffering can be avoided.

## Sharing
I love [sharing things](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/sharing.html) I make and I am open about most things I do and like as can be seen in this page already.

I share most of the code I write and release it as [Open Source](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github.html) for all other people to use and reuse as they like.

## Writing
I share my knowledge and experiences by writing about it in my [blog](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) and I maintain my own [personal wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) in the spirit of continuous learning.

## Music
I love listening to [new and interesting music](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev/playlist/0ERn0U4qZIKC8Dy7RrMMsn) and I curate [many playlists of music I like](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/music/music-playlists.html).

## Photographs
I love [making photographs](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/) and collecting [beautiful photographs and images](https://www.instagram.com/niikivi/).

## Great Software
Most notably:

- [Alfred](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/alfred/alfred.html)
- [Karabiner](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.html)
- [2Do](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/2do.html)
- [VS Code](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/text-editors/vs-code.html)
- [Keyboard Maestro](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/km/km.html)
- [Safari](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/web/browsers/safari.html)

But there is [many more](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os).

I hope to build my own app or tool that will join this list soon too.

### Alfred
Of most of software I like to use, Alfred takes the top place. I love extending this awesome launcher with workflows of my own. I use [AwGo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo) library for writing nearly all my workflows and I share all the workflows I made [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows#amazing-alfred-workflows-).

## Automation
I am a bit obsessed with automation and productivity. And I like to share all the interesting things I learn on this journey to a **perfect** setup.

Of course automation is not all and everything that I do but it greatly increases my satisfaction and happiness as I love focusing on solving problems and making new and interesting things rather than repeating myself over and over again.

## Freedom
I am a firm believer that everyone should have their opinion heard in the world. I think the current trend of monopolising all communication and all human activity under few companies is frightening.

I know from personal experience just how absurd it is to give away all your data and communication to some entity who then can manage what to do with it. Managing what people should see and what they can talk about. Overviewing every move you make and every word you type or say on their **platform**.

Fortunately there are decentralised platforms out there where no one restricts what you can send or say and no one is watching over what you do and write at every step. Where **you** are in control of your data. [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) is one such alternative.

## Quotes
I curate a GitHub list of all the interesting quotes I like [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/quotes#interesting-quotes-).

Below are some of my favourite quotes that I love. Starting with my favourite quote of all by Alan Watts.

> We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.

If you don't know Alan Watts, I reccomend you [check who he is](http://www.alanwatts.com/). He wrote [a few books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1501668.Alan_W_Watts?from_search=true) and did [many talks](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/humans/alan-watts.html).

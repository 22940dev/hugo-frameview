      <description>Animals I have been vegeterian for over 4 years now and it has been one of the best decisions I have made thus far in my life.
I think everyone has a choice nowadays of what they can eat and animal suffering can be avoided.
Writing I try to share my knowledge and experiences by writing about it in my blog and I maintain my own written knowledge wiki in the spirit of continuous learning.</description>
